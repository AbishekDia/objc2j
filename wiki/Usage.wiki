= Downloading files =

Actual build-archive is located here:

[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BygybWBe4h7pWVdGaUJTRVhMN0k/edit?usp=sharing build.zip]  

You have to unzip this zip. Inside you will found several .csv files, one jar (this is ObjC2J converter itself) and the folder named "jcocoa_extr". Last one contains three java files, which you will need in order to compile converted project. 

_Actually *jcocoa* project is on early starting stage, so huge number of classes aren't yet implemented_

Additionally you have to download dependency-libraries for project:

 * ant.jar
 * antlr-3.4-complete.jar
 * commons-io-2.0.1.jar
 * commons-loggins-1.1.1.jar
 * log4j-over-slf4j-1.6.4.jar
 * logback-classic-1.0.0.jar
 * logback-core-1.0.0.jar
 * slf4j-api-1.6.4.jar
 * javacsv.jar

(you can find these libraries in the web, just google it :), if you will not able to find some of them - email me, I'll try to help you).

= Converting =
To start converter use:

java -jar objc2j.jar <path_to_your_obj-c_project_sources>

While parsing converter can print a lot of parse-warnings. Don't worry about them: converter isn't able to properly read some Obj-c files - we are working about this issue.
Newly created Java files will be placed inside your project directory, near to their Obj-c original files.

If any questions, do not hesitate to ask me through email.
