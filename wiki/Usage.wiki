= Downloading files =
On the Downloads page you will find 3 files:

* converter.properties
* jcocoa_extr.zip
* ObjC2J.zip (fixed version, with fixed manifest.mf)

You have to download them all and unzip these two zip files in one folder.

Additionally you have to download dependency-libraries for project:

* ant.jar
* antlr-3.4-complete.jar
* commons-io-2.0.1.jar
* commons-loggins-1.1.1.jar
* log4j-over-slf4j-1.6.4.jar
* logback-classic-1.0.0.jar
* logback-core-1.0.0.jar
* slf4j-api-1.6.4.jar
* javacsv.jar

(you can find these libraries in the web, just google it :), if you will not able to find some of them - email me, I'll try to help you).

"converter.properties" file contains just one property. It is a path to MacOS SDK "Frameworks" directory.
E.g.: frameworks=C:\\MacOSX10.6.sdk\\MacOSX10.6.sdk\\System\\Library\\Frameworks\\

Last one step: you have to manually download three .csv files from sources of project. They are:
 * enums.csv
 * imports.csv
 * staticFields.csv

and copy them into directory with libraries and .property file.

= Converting =
To start converter use:

java -jar objc2j.jar <path_to_your_obj-c_project_sources>

While parsing converter can print a lot of parse-warnings. Don't worry about them: converter isn't able to properly read some Obj-c files - we are working about this issue.
Newly created Java files will be placed inside your project directory, near to their Obj-c original files.

If any questions, do not hesitate to ask me through email.
